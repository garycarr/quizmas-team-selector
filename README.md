# quizmas-team-selector

This was a project which was rushed a few hours before a quiz I was hosting.  It was set up to randomly pick four teams of two people, where girls and boys could not be on the same team.  See it in action

To use swap the pictures in the `/pics` folder with who you want then open `index.html`.

It's unlikely this will get worked on again, the major TODO is to allow any number of participants.
