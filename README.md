# quizmas-team-selector

Swap the pics to people in your group, and update the array with the names of those files.
Make the backgroud pic and the music whatever you want, then open index.html in your browser.

This only works with 8 people where 4 are girls!  This was a project which was rushed a couple
of hours before a quiz, I will only update if there is demand to do so.
